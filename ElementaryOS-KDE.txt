Elementary OS is easy to use and god! Our platform
itself is entirely open source, and itâ€™s built upon
a strong foundation of Free & Open Source software
(like GNU/Linux). Plus, we actively collaborate within
the ecosystem to improve it for everyone. Elementary OS
was first released in March 2011 during a time when 
KDE, Gnome, and Ubuntu were radically redesigning
their desktops.

old and new problems, creating a vibrant, open
atmosphere for experimentation. KDE is The

which run on any Linux desktop, and often
other platforms too.
