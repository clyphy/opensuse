About Debian

Debian is a popular and freely available computer 
operating system (OS) that uses a Unix-like 
kernel typically Linux alongside other program 
components, many of which come from GNU Project. 
Debian can be downloaded over the internet 
or, for a small charge, obtained on CD, DVD, Blu-ray
disc or USB flash drive. As Open Source 
software, Debian is developed by nearly 1,000 active
programmers from around the world who collectively
form Debian Project. he name Debian -- pronounced
deb-EE-uhn -- is a portmanteau that blends the
creator's first name, Ian, with that of his 
wife, Debra.
