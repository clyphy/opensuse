Tools that i USE

About Raft WSL for Windows 11

Raft WSL is a powerful tool for managing Windows Subsystem for 
Linux (WSL) distributions, enabling installation, snapshots,
version control, and seamless integration with Windows tools.

About X410 - X Server for Windows

Do you want to seamlessly use Linux GUI apps side by side
with Windows apps? Simply start X410 and adjust a few
settings; your Linux GUI apps then suddenly appear in
Windows and you can use them like Windows apps!
It doesn't matter where your Linux GUI apps are actually
running; it can be a full virtual machine, Docker 
Container, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or whatever. As
long as your Linux GUI apps support X-Window client
protocols, you can use them in Windows. You can even
securely use your Linux GUI apps running in a far remote
server via any SSH client that supports X11 forwarding
over the Internet.
