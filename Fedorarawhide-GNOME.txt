What is Fedora RawHide - https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/rawhide

Rawhide is sometimes called "development" or "main". Fedora
RawHide is the future.

Rawhide is the name given to the current development version
of Fedora Linux. It consists of a package repository called
rawhide and contains the latest build of all Fedora Linux 
packages updated on a daily basis. Each day, the build system 
attempts to create a full set of deliverables ,images and so on
and all that compose successfully are included in the 
Rawhide tree for that day.

Fedora, also known as Fedora Linux, is a popular Open Source
Linux-based operating system (OS). Designed as a secure, general
purpose OS, Fedora is developed on a six-month to eight-month
release cycle under the Fedora Project. Both the OS and the
Fedora Project are financially sponsored and supported
by Red Hat. Fedora is a free and open source OS 
platform for hardware, clouds and containers. Based on the
Linux OS kernel architecture, Fedora Linux is a user-friendly
OS that enables users to perform their tasks easily and
efficiently with minimal friction. The name Fedora refers to
the characteristic fedora hat in Red Hat's Shadowman logo.

What is GNOME desktop - https://www.gnome.org

An easy and elegant way to use your computer, GNOME
is designed to help you have the best possible computing
experience. Every part of GNOME has been designed to
make it simple and easy to use. The Activities Overview
is a simple way to access all your basic tasks. A press of
a button is all it takes to view your open windows, launch
applications, or check if you have new messages.
Having everything in one convenient place means you donâ€™t
have to learn your way around a maze of different
technologies. GNOME provides a focused working Environment
that helps you get things done. It is packed with features
that will make you more productive: a powerful search feature
that helps you access all your work from one place; side-by-side
windows that make it easy to view several documents at the same
time; seamless integration with online accounts which allows
you to access all your data in one place; and a messaging
system that comfortably deals with notifications, letting
you quickly respond in place or return to them in
a convenient time.
